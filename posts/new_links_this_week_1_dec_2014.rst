.. summary: Interesting links I found this week


* `Everything about memory management`_. An interesting link about memory management, an area that I don't know much about because most of the languages I work in have built-in garbage collection.

* `O'Reilly Introduction to Go Programming`_. I started learning Go this month. John Graham-Cumming's Video lectures are my starting point and they are very good. 

* `Go Indexing Library`_. An interesting library for text indexing. 

* `Camlistore`_. A cms library in Go. Asset management applications in Media can use this library.

* `My tribute to Roger Ebert`_. My answer to a Quora question. Roger Ebert was my favourite film critic and his Great movies list is the best curation.
