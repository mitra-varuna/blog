 Setting
=====================
Modern world inhabited by the immortal Gods who look like regular human beings.
America has been a melting pot of cultures from around the world. The ancient Gods
worshipped by people from around the world have fallen out of favour from the
people. The ancient Gods are replaced by new 'Gods' like the Media, Television, and
the new kid on the block, the Internet. The normal human beings are unaware that
the Gods are living among them. The Gods do odd jobs like driving cabs, tell fortunes
and even escorts to earn their livelihood.


It appears that the Gods survive on people's faith. Faith is the currency of the
Gods, both old and new.
