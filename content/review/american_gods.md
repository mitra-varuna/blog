American Gods, written by Neil Gaiman, is muti-genre fantasy novel set in the turn-of-century America where
Gods walk the Earth with the mortals.
=======
 American Gods is a fantasy, Americana novel set in the turn of the 21st century America.

*** There are spoilers in the Settings as well as the Plot sections; please skip to the end to know about my thoughts and reflections.***

 Setting
=====================
Modern world inhabited by the immortal Gods who look like regular human beings.
America has been a melting pot of cultures from around the world. The ancient Gods
worshipped by people from around the world have fallen out of favour from the
people. The ancient Gods are replaced by new 'Gods' like the Media, Television, and
the new kid on the block, the Internet. The normal human beings are unaware that
the Gods are living among them. The Gods do odd jobs like driving cabs, tell fortunes
and even escorts to earn their livelihood.


It appears that the Gods survive on people's faith. Faith is the currency of the
Gods, both old and new.

Popular culture

Faith is a crucial resource
American of the 2000s

Plot
====
Wednesday, an American version of the Norse God Odin, has taken upon himself to wage a war against the new Gods. He hires Shadow, a reformed convict, to help him with the war. Together they travel around America, seeking help from the ancient Gods, who have *retired*, and lead a normal human-being-like life. It is not clear what killing the new Gods alludes to, perhaps a Luddite revolution.

Wednesday reaches out to several Gods from different pantheons.

Thoughts
========
The novel is littered with allusions. There are many allusions to the World Mythology.
I was fascinated with Comparative Mythology ever since I read Joseph Campbell's excellent Masks of God series.
The central characters Wednesday is an obvious allusion to the Norse God - Odin. Shadow meets several Gods from 
different pantheons.

Neil is describing America. America and mainly cosmopolitan American Cities are melting pots of culture, a 
pot-pourri of faiths and beliefs from cultures and religions. The Gods, who can be interpreted as thoughtforms,
have to change and adapt; so much so that some of these mythic beings have to eke out their living through the 
American Way. It is an allusion to the American Way of Life - everyone's a small fish in the big pond, God or not,
and "there ain't no such thing as a free lunch". The Gods have resigned to a life where they do not depend on their
worshippers any longer. They are content with whatever oblations, little or negligent, they receive from their followers.

The new Gods represent Media and Automation. The Gods of the future, people rely on them, live by them and revere them
They are not abstract Gods. These are essential tools for modern living. 

Overall, I found the premise interesting. There are layers to each description and plot twists. I enjoyed the references
and the I-see-what-you-did-there moments.
