* Characters
* Tell about the Story, story is about how characters grow, change, and become
* Characters internal growth conflict - internal and external
* Plot points - Are they copied
* Why is it speculative fiction

* Plot
* What moves the story forward?
* What lets us keep up with the flow of information?
* How many nests? Arcs? Characters? Reward cycles?
* Cast of interesting &sympathetic characters in a complex and rich world
* The plot points in the novels are a nod to the televised series. The narrative, to borrow a term from the novel, is metafiction, and the writer cleverly
deconstructs the scifi series' plot points.
