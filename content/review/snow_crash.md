* A brief summary of what the novel is about

* Your personal connection
** How you feel about the 90s culture
** Matrix
** Political movements of the 90s
** 90s subculture 

An overarching idea of *Snow Crash* is the idea of a virus.
Virus, as you know, might mean one of these things - 

* A biological microbe which spreads diseases
* In the context of computers and networking, a Virus is a computer program that replicates itself many times over on a host machines and stalls any useful work

Neal borrows ideas from *Memetics* and extends the idea of Virus in an abstract fashion. A Virus is an abstract concept which spreads itself through any population.
The medium of spread could be anything - in the context of a viral disease it is a human body and human contact; in the context of a networked computer it is the operating
system. When we say that a particular idea or a social media post has become viral, we are talking about Virus in the abstract term. Mass Hysteria is a spread of a viral 
idea which spreads FUD in the people. A fad is a virus which spread through the population using mass media. A law is a viral idea which is spread through the established
machinery of Governance. A language is also a medium for a Viral breakout. Neal goes a step further and points out that the mythical struggle between good and evil is the
eternal struggle of mankind to prevent the spread of Virus or a Viral outbreak. 



** Sumerian Myth

What stands out in Neal's writing is that the abstraction or analogies. He makes extensive use of his knowledge of computers and compare their operations to the workings
of psyche. So, language is the operating system or the software which is run on the hardware of our brain. And just like an operating system can run different programs using 
the hardware, language can mould our worldview and can be used to run malicious or helpful programs.


* Hacking and its subculture
** Avataars, Jacked in, Network programming, graphics, daemons as utility programs
** valley culture
