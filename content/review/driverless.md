* Driverless cars are autonomous robots which drive cars with human-like precision, call them robotic chauffers if you will. Imagine a world where cars drive themselves, pick you up from any place, and then leave you to your 
destination; and then imagine a fleet of cars coordinating among themselves transporting materials and people
without any human intervention, taking shortest path considering road conditions, traffic situation and any other
disruptions by being preemptively notified. Driverless cars or Self Driving cars which caught our fantasy few years ago are a reality now. Google was one of the first companies to build a prototype and iterate over the prototype
for years now. Hod Lipson and Melba Kurman's "Driverless" is an ethnograpical and anthropological study which traces the evolution of Self driving cars from being a public fantasy to a fully realized industrial grade prototypes and models.

The idea of self driving cars or at least autonomous transportation has caught public imagination for more than four decades now. The authors describe that in the early part of 20th century a small scale version of autonomous
transportation was on display which caught everyone's fanatasy in the day. One of the biggest missteps towards
autonomous transportation was the work towards intelligent highways which regulate and automate the transportation
of vehicles in its lanes. The authors describe that the idea was doomed from the start because it did not
leverage existing infrastructure and needed special vehicles to run on the highways; which was, let's face it, 
not going to happen.



[Trolley problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trolley_problem) is the ethical framework that the authors use to
analyze ethical problems faced when we undertake widespread adoption of self driving cars. Imagine you are driving
a vehicle and you come across a fork in the road or the tracks. In one the tracks, five people are tied to the
tracks and it is invetible that these people will die when you take this track. In the other track, there's only
one person tied to the track. You have to choose one of these options, what would your choice be? This is the simplest form of the trolley problem. There are other variations as well. In a variation of the trolley problem,
the one person tied to the track has greater intrinsic social value, say the person is a doctor, what would the
choice be then? In another variation the person tied to the track is the driver's son, someone who has more
value to the person in control, what should the choice be then? There's an online platform called the [Moral Machine](http://moralmachine.mit.edu/) which is using crowd sourcing to understand ethical decision making in the large
using the trolley problem. Autonomous vehicles, and by that I mean the people in charge of making them as well
as the Government machinery which allows their usage, are continuously studying the challenges and ethical 
repercussions of the decisions. Whether these decisions will we outsourced at run time to a Moral Machine, only time wil tell. With increased profiling of the prople using the Social Machine, I will not be surprised if such a machine or algorithm already exists.
