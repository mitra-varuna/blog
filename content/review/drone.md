> The Rocket man had it coming, the old man didn't.

* Martin Scorsese's Silence God's Point of View
* Drone Warfare has brought a paradigm shift in the way War operates.
** Asymmetry 
** War is almost like a day-job
** Harder than operating a regular plane, you have to be cognizant of data, chats and the angle of view
** No sense of espirit de corps
** The psychological torque created by oscillations between the domestic life and the ordeals of being in a war zone.
** The question of Valor    


* The personnel who fly drones are seated in a trailer, a souped-up shipping container, which is fitted with padded seats,
several computer screens and the controls for flying the drone. Usually the personnel comprises a pilot, a sensor operator and 
an intelligence analyst. The personnel works twelve hour shifts, six days a week. Flying a drone is different than flying a fighter plane - you have 
to build a three-dimensional picture of the drone's position using camera, chats and texts, dials and gauges using both overhaed
and sideways screens. During a "kill", the trailer lightens up with myriad texts, radio signal interpreters, chats and commands.
The moment of missile impact, the "splash", which kills people by incinerating them, generating a blast wave that crushes
the targets or nearby humans internal organs and unleashes a shower of high-velocity steel sharpnels. The crew then identifies
the runaway insurgents, the "squirters", assesses the damage and does reporting. The drone warfare takes its worst 
toll on the citizens of the target city. A drone does several rounds before assessing the positions of those on the kill-list.
There's a constant hum in the air. The "psychic imprisonment" by endless flying watchtowers creates a sense of panic.
Those who live under the drones are increasingly showing many symptoms of posttraumatic stress, including breakdowns, nightmares,
outbursts of anger and irritability, loss of appetite, sleeplessness, physical malaise, and unexplained physical pains.
